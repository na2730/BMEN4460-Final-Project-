# BMEN4460-Final-Project-
A GitHub repository for keeping all files and scripts needed for the final project. If you notice any mistakes or issues feel free to make the commits and pull requests. Still getting a handle of this new system.


## Moving Forward (4/17/20)
After looking at the data and setting goals, we will go through the respective datasets (MedSegmentation and UCSD) in order to build up a classifier for COVID-19 and also the lung and COVID-19 symptom segmentations. I have uploaded the respective datasets in the folders above. Please add any code you are using to the scripts file so we can establish a master branch for this project. 

Below is the link to the Google Drive which we are also using for this project in case somethign is missing:
