A GitHub repository for keeping all files and scripts needed for the final project. 


## Moving Forward ( 4/17/20)
After looking at the data and setting goals, we will go through the respective datasets (MedSegmentation and UCSD) in order to build up a classifier for COVID-19 and also the lung and COVID-19 symptom segmentations. I have uploaded the respective datasets in the folders above. Please add any code you are using to the scripts file so we can establish a master branch for this project.
